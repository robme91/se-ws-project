# se-ws-project
This is a semester project for the topic code generation. The implementation is a java game using the libary slick2d


For starting the game from intellij, edit the run configurations. You have to add the path to the native directory for the os you use.
e.g.  -Djava.library.path="<my-project>\Slick2D_Playground\target\natives\windows"
